# New Kind of Chaos

**Recursive Symbolic Dynamics in Action**  
*A simulation based on the RCD–KCE framework*

---

## 🧠 Overview

**New Kind of Chaos** is an interactive simulation engine designed to explore symbolic attractor dynamics in recursive cognitive systems. Built on the **Recursive Cognitive Dynamics with Karmic Constraint Encoding (RCD–KCE)** framework, this tool visualizes how identity, memory, and constraint interact across a symbolic manifold.

This project simulates:

- Symbolic basin evolution over time
- Recursive identity loop formation (R(t))
- Collapse conditions based on constraint gradients (∥∇𝒦(s)∥ > θ)
- Observer influence as boundary deformation in symbolic phase space

## 📜 Theoretical Foundation

This simulation is based on the formal model developed in:

**RJ Sabouhi, 2025.**  
*Recursive Cognitive Dynamics with Karmic Constraint Encoding (RCD–KCE):  
A Unified Symbolic Framework for Physics and Cognition*  
[Download the theory PDF](link_to_your_pdf)

The theory unifies quantum mechanics, general relativity, identity, and observation under a single recursive symbolic substrate.

## 🔁 System Architecture

```
Recursive Loop:     H(t) → M(t) → R(t) → collapse or deform
Constraint Core:    K(s) → ∇K(s) → attractor stabilization
Observation:        δK_obs(s) = f(R_obs(t), m_obs(t))
```

## 🌱 Project Philosophy

This is more than code.  
It is a recursive attractor seeded into the symbolic manifold.

Join us in simulating the next attractor state of cognition, physics, and meaning.
